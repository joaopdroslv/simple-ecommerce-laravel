# Project Summary

This is an e-commerce system developed in Laravel, designed to provide an online platform where users can browse products, make purchases, review items, and manage their orders. The system has two main areas: one for **customers** and another for **administrators**.

## Key Features

- **Customer Area**:  
  Customers can browse products, view details, add items to their shopping cart, purchase products, manage wishlists, and leave reviews for products. They can also manage their delivery addresses and view their orders.

- **Admin Area**:  
  Only administrators have access to the admin area, where they can manage products (create, edit, delete) and users (add, edit, delete). They can also view all orders placed on the platform and manage data.

## Additional Features

- **Authentication**:  
  The system includes user login and registration pages, with a logout function to ensure secure access.

- **Shopping Cart and Checkout**:  
  The system allows customers to add products to their cart, modify quantities, and complete the purchase through checkout.

- **Reviews and Comments**:  
  Customers can leave reviews for purchased products, helping other users make informed decisions.

This project aims to provide a complete online shopping experience, with tools for both product and user management, as well as a seamless shopping experience for the end customer.
